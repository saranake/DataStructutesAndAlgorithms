Refer to slide 4 from slides.
Hamiltonian path is an ordered list of nodes in the graph. 
Every node in this list has a position (e.g. A is at position 1, B is at position B etc.)

We have to find an order subject to these constraints:


(1) Every node must occupy some position. 
(2) One node can't take two or more position
(3) Two nodes can't take one position

(4) Every position on the path must be occupied
(5) Only two nodes that are adjacent in the graph can be adjacent on the path. 

Clause Generation:

For a graph with "n" nodes, hamiltonian path will have "n" nodes.
Any node can take any one of "n" position. That means we will need "n" variables
for each node. e.g. Variable X(1,1) = 1 assigns node 1 to position 1, X(2,1) assigns
position 2 on the path and so on. In general, X(p,n) = 1 assigns node n to position p.

Lers assume graph with 4 nodes, A,B, C and D

(1) Every node must ocuppy some position.
